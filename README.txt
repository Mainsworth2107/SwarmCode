README for DBA code

DBA Algorithm (Andina et al): Implementation and verification of DBA Algorithm

FLIES:

distEU: Calculates the euclidian distance between any equal sized point sets (A) and (B).

extPoses.m Extracts the pose information from each robot to allow for the environment object to plot them.

flush.m Resets all figures, variables and command line interface for a clean run.

height.m Returns the height of a 2d matrix.

initBots.m Initialises a random robot placement to mimic a single allocation situation within the simulation.
 
main.m main code run for simulation. Calls all other functions in its process.

newfit.m: Uses the method described in Andina et al to produce an allocation for each robot in the swarm.

robot.m Class file for each robot that contains the FSM code used for iterative running.
